QURAN TOPIC MODELING ANALYSIS - JOURNAL TEMPLATE

1. INTRODUCTION
This study applies two topic modeling approaches - Correlated Topic Model (CTM) and BERTopic -
to analyze the thematic structure of the Quranic text in Indonesian translation.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Data Preprocessing
- Dataset: 110 suras, 5767 verses
- Text cleaning: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal
- Tokenization and stemming applied
- Final corpus: 5767 documents with average length of 10.4 tokens

2.2 Models
- CTM: 15 topics using tomotopy implementation
- BERTopic: Transformer-based topic modeling with multilingual BERT

3. RESULTS
3.1 CTM Results
- Number of topics identified: 15
- Key themes identified across suras
- Document-topic distribution shows 110/110 sura coverage

3.2 BERTopic Results
- Number of topics identified: 82
- Outlier verses: 1941
- Topic diversity and coherence measures

4. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
4.1 Topic Coherence
- CTM shows strength in capturing broader thematic structures
- BERTopic demonstrates strength in identifying nuanced sub-themes

4.2 Sura-wise Analysis
- CTM dominant topics distributed across suras
- BERTopic provides verse-level thematic analysis

5. THEMATIC INTERPRETATION
Based on the topic models, key Quranic themes identified include:
• Faith and belief
• Social justice
• Moral guidance
• Historical narratives
• Legal principles

6. CONCLUSION
Both CTM and BERTopic provide complementary insights into Quranic thematic structure.
CTM offers interpretable broad themes while BERTopic captures detailed semantic patterns.
